This Mini project is built as a task for WebEngage task submission. 
Specifications mentioned in the task are listed below:
Working of Pop Up:

The pop up will slide in from the top of the viewport.
The pop up contains cards with "Coupon Code" as a heading.
If the user clicks on the "COPY CODE" button of a card, the respective coupon code of that card should be copied in the Clipboard accordingly.
Clicking on the close icon will remove the pop up with slide up animation.

The project contents a form, along with the option to get pop up of the coups listed for ease of navigation on all devices. The Coupon code can be copied by clicking on the coupon code.
